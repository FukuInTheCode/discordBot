Hey! 

This is my first ever big project using node.js.
And this is a bot discord that help me to learn Node.js/MySQL/Git and maybe other in the futur.

Understand that this is not intended to be release but you can always install the packages and use it on your discord application 
but there is some complication about the SQL server because you will need the same server configuration as me 
and I intend to add the .sql file to create the databases needed.

Enjoy reading my terrible code :)
